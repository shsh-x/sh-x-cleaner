# Hello there
This is a rough coded python script for cleaning osu! songs from junk.
It basically removes everything that is not a difficulty file and the song itself.
Optionally you can choose a custom bg to replace in every song.

To start doing funny things just start .exe file or run .py script if you're scared of .exe files.

Feel free to open issue if you have any suggestions on the optimization.

Python 3.12 is used btw
