# Hello there

This is a rough coded python script for cleaning osu! songs from junk.
It basically removes everything except the difficulty files and the song itself.
Optionally, you can choose a custom bg to replace in every song.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12

## Getting Started

To start doing funny things you can either:

### Run the Executable

1. Download the `.exe` file from the releases section.
2. Run the `.exe` file.

### Build the Executable

If you prefer to build the executable yourself:

1. Install [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/):

   ```sh
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Run the build script:

   ```sh
   python build_exe.py
   ```

3. Run the generated `.exe` file (putted to dist directory).

### Run the Script Directly (are you scared of .exe?)

1. Ensure Python 3.12 is installed on your system.
2. Run the script directly:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Issues and Contributions

If you have any suggestions for optimization or encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on the project's repository.
